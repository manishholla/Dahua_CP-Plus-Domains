# Dahua_CP-Plus-Domains
Hostnames that probably ping back your camera feed (if you use CP Plus or Dahua cameras) to vendor.

Add this to your router / network firewall to block traffic thereby blocking camera feed to vendor.

I will try to update this list whenever possible. You are free to modify this as per your requirement.

Suggestions are always welcomed. If I have added any hostname that is vital for DVR / NVR functioning, please do suggest.
